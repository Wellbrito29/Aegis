# Generated outputs

Everything Aegis Spec produces goes to the `aegis/` folder (or whatever name you configure in `config.toml`). The legacy project is never touched.

The set of artifacts generated depends on the **documentation level** chosen at the start of the analysis:

| Legend | Level |
|--------|-------|
| *(all)* | Generated at all 3 levels |
| *(complete+)* | Only at `complete` and `detailed` levels |
| *(detailed)* | Only at `detailed` level |

## Traceability

Two files connect everything:

**`traceability/code-spec-matrix.md`:** maps each code file to its corresponding spec, with coverage level. You know what's covered and what isn't.

**`traceability/spec-impact-matrix.md`:** maps which component impacts which. Before changing something, you know the blast radius of the change.

## What not to commit

Suggested `.gitignore` to avoid versioning Aegis Spec outputs alongside code (unless you want to):

```gitignore
# Aegis Spec outputs (optional: remove if you want to version the specs)
aegis/

# Personal Aegis Spec configuration (never commit)
aegis/config.user.toml
```

---

## Next step

Specs in hand? See [Developing from specs](../desenvolvendo-com-specs.md) for the recommended order to build the system.
